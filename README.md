## Targeted Epigenetic T cell Subtyping Using Long Reads

Code required to reproduce the analyses published in Goldsmith et al. 2022

# main analyses:

- differential methylation Th0 vs Th1
- differential methylation Th0 vs Th2
- differential methylation Th0 vs Th17
- differential methylation Th0 vs Treg
- differential methylation Treg vs tTreg vs DMK
- differential methylation Th17 WT vs TGFb-KO

- off-target TF enrichment analysis

# plots:

- all loci and all T cell types
- Treg vs tTreg vs DMK?
- Th17 WT vs TGFb-KO?
